# AI Matte Painting
This tool uses AI to assist in creating 3D scenes. It generates and produces 3D scenes from simple prompts.

The tool is made up of five modules, based on the steps for creating a scene: image generation, image cleaning, depth calculation, image segmentation, and image-to-3D conversion. Each module can be used on its own or in combination with the others.
