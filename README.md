## Overview

This tool provides a comprehensive AI toolset to help creators build 3D scenes in no time, from image generation to 3D model. The toolset consists of five main modules: Image Generation, Image Cleanup, Depth Calculation, Image Slicing, and Image to 3D Conversion. Each module can operate independently, but can also be used in conjunction with each other.

## Installation
Currently the plugin support Unreal Engine 5.3. Before using it, make sure the required models, packages, and CUDA are successfully installed. This ensures the plugin work properly.

### 1. Models and Libraries
- Libraries: Place the Libraries folder under the plugin (Plugins\MoonshineEngine\Libraries)
- AI Models: Place the Models folder under the plugin (Plugins\MoonshineEngine\Models)

### 2. CUDA
The MoGe model (360Â° depth calculation) within the tool requires CUDA to run. To match the Torch version installed within the tool, CUDA version 12.9 is required. For a comparison of Torch and CUDA versions, refer to "https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/." You can verify your computer's CUDA version by entering the following command in CMD:
```python
nvidia-smi
```
